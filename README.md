# link-handler
Link and hide pesky application folders in the Windows "Documents" library.

If you're like me, you HATE seeing dozens of application folders cluttering your Documents library.
Well, look no further than the LinkHandler line of BASH tools!

## Getting Started
1. Move the .bat files into your Documents folder
2. Run the .bat file from the command line: `.\AppLinkHandler.bat`
